## Community Finance

### Summary

Collective enables people to come together to form an investment club on Urbit. The originator of the club sets the initial parameters, such as:

- Name of the club
- Maximum investment threshold
- Initial members

Once these are set from the front end, you click `create fund` button and an instance of the investment club will be minted and deployed onto Uqbar - an Urbit native L2 zkSTARK rollup.

Members can then deposit `zig`s and receive 1:1 `shares` to `zig`s to represent there ownership in the fund.   private group is spun up with a `poke` to the new Groups and only the members of the fund are allowed into the room.

### Local Desk development

* reference [Urbit Developer Environment Setup](https://developers.urbit.org/guides/core/environment) for more info.

1. create a fakeship outside of the cloned repo

   ```sh
   ./urbit -F zod
   ```

2. start the fakeship

   ```sh
   ./urbit zod
   ```

3. on the fakeship create a `%collective` desk

   ```sh
   |mount %base
   |merge %collective our %base
   |mount %collective
   ```

4. start a watcher in a new terminal, to sync the novel code into the fakeship

   ```sh
   watch rsync -zr --delete /location/of/collective/desk/* /path/to/fake/zod/collective
   ```

5. install `%collective` on the fakeship

   ```sh
   |commit %collective
   |install %collective
   ```




### UI

```bash
npm install
```
then
```bash
npm start
```
